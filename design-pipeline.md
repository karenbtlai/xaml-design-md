# XAML Controls Open Source Design Guidelines

## How to Contribute

You can contribute to WinUI's designs by filing a Design Proposal issue through Github. Once submitted, the request will be in queue to be reviewed, prototyped (this you can contribute to as well), and user tested internally. 

## Steps

1. **Review the Figma Xaml Controls Design Guide.** This will ensure that the newly proposed feature or enhancement will be coherent with Microsoft branding

2. **Fill out this Feature Specification Template.** Wireframes, videos, interactive prototypes, etc. are strongly encouraged to help clarify design intent, behaviour, and speed up the internal review process.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suggested tools include: Figma, Sketch, Marvel, InVision, or code prototypes

3. **Open a Design Proposal issue on Github** with the filled out Feature Specification Template. The issue will then be triaged and in queue for the review process.

## Review Process

Once the proposal has been filed under Github Issues, it will be triaged and be in queue for the review process. This internal review process is needed so that XAML Controls is coherent with the rest of Microsoft branding.

1. **Internal designers review the proposal.** If there are any gaps in the design, we will work with you in clarifying the design intent.

2. **Prototype of proposed feature** The team will prototype the proposed feature. If the contributor already has a built prototype for testing, this will help speed up the process.

3. **User Research** If required, formal user research will be conducted to make sure the proposed feature is what's best for the end users. Studies and its outcomes will be shared after completion.
